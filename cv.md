#### About Yourself

Hello! My name is Vika. I am 23 years old. I have been programming since I was in school, but after trying different fields in IT, I have only now found mine. And at the moment I am mastering this direction, which interested me.
Shortly after graduating from school, I started working as a junior system administrator in an Internet company, working as a technical support specialist, network operations center agent. Later, I started teaching programming at an IT school, at that time I was engaged in game development, so I taught game development on Unity and Unreal Engine. And also Arduino.
My goal is to become a front-end developer, be a part of interesting projects, look for unusual solutions and create a user interface that will be as convenient as possible. In the future, I dream of opening my own IT school. Because it is a priority for me to make a significant contribution to the development of IT education for children in Ukraine. My strengths are determination, stress resistance, creativity and communication, ability to work in a team.
